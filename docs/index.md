# Mind Racing Wiki

This is the official wiki for the Mind Racing repository. Mind Racing is a mind-controlled multiplayer 3D racing game to demonstrate the possibilities of the Internet of Humans and the underlying brain/cloud interface architecture as part of my bachelor thesis.

## Getting Started

The repository is a monorepo and includes various sub-projects. I utilised [Yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) for handling the dependencies for each workspace (the LaTeX and Jekyll sub-projects excluded). To start working on the repository, install all dependencies via `yarn install`.

CD into the different directories to have a look at the different sub-projects. [Here](https://github.com/danburonline/mind-racing#directories) is an overview of the different directories.

## About This Wiki

This wiki concentrates on the top-down concepts utilised in developing Mind Racing, e.g. how the authentication works or how I built the automated documentation. Have a look at the categories in the menu of this wiki. You can also use the search to find results by a specific topic or keyword.

If you think something isn't included in the wiki, or some topic isn't covered well, write me an email to **[public@danielburger.online](mailto:public@danielburger.online)**.
