# Domains

I bought the `mind.racing` domain on [Google Domains](https://domains.google) via my personal Google Account. The domain is connected to the Google Cloud Platform name servers. I manage the subdomains like `staging.mind.racing` and `wiki.mind.racing` on Google Domains itself. There are also various automatic redirects from the `www.*` subdomains to the `mind.racing` domains.

The SSL certificates are all managed by Google and securing the ICANN domain information to ensure my privacy.

Only the `wiki.mind.racing` subdomain points to the GitHub Pages of the Mind Racing repository. This SSL certificate is the only one that's managed by GitHub rather than Google Domains.
