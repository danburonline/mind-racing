# GitHub Action Workflows

This folder contains all the workflow YAML files for GitHub Actions. I leverage GitHub action to automate the deployment of all services and their documentations. Next to that, I also use GitHub Actions to automate integration pipelines with formatting, linting, testing, etc. Have a look at the various files in this folder.
