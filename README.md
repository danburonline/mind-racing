# Spatial Place

Spatial Place is the title of my bachelor thesis project, in which I research the production-grade and deployable applicability of brain-computer interface technology via the cloud to extend human-computer interaction for web-based virtual reality applications.

## Background

My bachelor project was completed in collaboration with [IDUN Technologies](https://iduntechnologies.com) and their proprietary [DRYODEâ„¢ Guardian](https://iduntechnologies.com/guardian-dev-kit) product, an electroencephalography (EEG) sensor that resembles a standard in-ear headphone. Since the start of my undergraduate project, I've been working for IDUN as a full-stack software engineer, revising the Guardian software products to make them more user-friendly, functional, and cloud-ready. IDUN aims to create a cloud platform with a scalable and robust architecture for deploying and managing EEG machine learning classifiers. This includes an SDK and API for interacting with the Guardian hardware.

Both the Guardian SDK and API are used in my project. Because the source code is proprietary and hence subject to a copyrighted license, I cannot put it in a public repository. I can, however, share with you the source code for the demo application under the `/code` directory. As part of my project submission, I have included a copy of the SDK and API source code, including the demo application, so that the examiners may see the code and understand how the SDK and API work when evaluating my project.

## Other Artefacts

- All figures that I created on my own can be found under this [URL](https://www.figma.com/file/lSKhgYwDk9KIQbGooflm4X/figures?node-id=0%3A1).
- There is a Figma file where I have drawn the wireframes for the project, ideated on concepts and other things. It is available under this [URL](https://www.figma.com/file/ilbGE5j3KZB1TUZwYX7FJm/ideation?node-id=103%3A2).
- You can find the whiteboard in Figma via this [URL](https://www.figma.com/file/bYgmQkS6tlizeVgHK3YWT1/whiteboard?node-id=0%3A1). It includes ideas, old drafts, and notes from the project.
