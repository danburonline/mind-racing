# Spatial Place

![Neural/cloud interface](./thesis/src/Appendix1/Figs/nci-definition.png)

Spatial Place is the project title of my bachelor thesis, in which I researched and explored the mass-market applicability of a novel software system for bringing brain–computer interface software to the cloud. I called the product of this new interdisciplinary field between brain–computer interface software and cloud computing a **neural/cloud interface**.

## Description

My bachelor thesis was completed in collaboration with [IDUN Technologies](https://iduntechnologies.com) and their proprietary [DRYODE™ Guardian](https://iduntechnologies.com/guardian-dev-kit) product, an electroencephalography (EEG) sensor that resembles a standard in-ear headphone. Since the start of my undergraduate project, I've been working for IDUN as a cloud software engineer, revising the Guardian software products to make them more user-friendly, functional, and especially cloud-ready. IDUN aims to create a cloud platform with a scalable and robust architecture for deploying and managing neural signal processing pipelines. This includes an public SDK and API for interacting with the Guardian hardware as well as a cloud infrastructure, microservice cluster and internal SDK as described in the thesis.

Because the source code of the mentioned software components is proprietary and hence subject to a copyrighted license, I cannot put it in a public repository. I have included a copy of the associated repositories, so that the examiners may see the source code and understand how the neural/cloud interface works in implementation when evaluating my project.
