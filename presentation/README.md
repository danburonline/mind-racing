# Bachelor Presentation

This directory contains all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to display interactive slides for my bachelor presentation as part of my defense. I used [Slides.com](https://slides.com) to create the exported files.

In order to view the presentation one can either open the `index.html` file (don't forget to download the entire `presentation` folder in order to make the images etc. work) in a browser or use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.
