# Bachelor Thesis

This directory contains all the LaTeX files to create a PDF for my bachelor thesis. I use Overleaf to edit the `.tex` files and collaborate with my supervisors and proofreaders. Optionally one can also compile the LaTeX project locally, I've used [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/howto/miktex-console) for this and utilised [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) for VS Code to make the editing easier on my MacBook Pro.

## Technologies

- **Editors:** Overleaf and LaTeX Workshop for VS Code
- **Compiler:** MikTeX for macOS
- **Reference manager:** Zotero
- **Bibliography:** BibLaTeX

Have a look a the [thesis.tex](src/thesis.tex) file to see how the underlying LaTeX project is structured to create the final PDF file.
