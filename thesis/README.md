# Bachelor Thesis

This directory contains all the LaTeX files to create a PDF for my bachelor thesis. I use Overleaf to edit the `.tex` files and collaborate with my supervisors and my proofreaders.

## Technologies

- **Editor:** Overleaf with a GitHub Sync
- **Reference manager:** Zotero
- **Bibliography:** BibLaTeX

Have a look a the [thesis.tex](src/thesis.tex) file to see how the underlying LaTeX project is structured to create the final PDF file.
