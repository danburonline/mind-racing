\chapter{User interviews and outline}
\label{appendix3-user-interviews-and-outline}

This appendix chapter lists the outline and rough framework used to conduct the user interviews, as well as the notes taken by the author and IDUNâ€™s product manager, Mark Melnykowycz, during the interview sessions. The notes are represented in the state they were in at the time of recording. The focus was on conducting user interviews especially in the Robbie and Evan personas, as they were the first actual users of the software platform targeted by the C-level management.
