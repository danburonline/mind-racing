	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore the development of brain-computer interfacing and cloudminds as possible future scenarios. I describe potential applications such as selling unused brain processing cycles and the blockchaining of personality functions. The possibility of ubiquitous brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that are continuously connected to the Internet suggests interesting options for our future selves. Questions about what it is to be human, the nature of our current existence and interaction with reality, and how things might be different could become more prominent. I examine speculative future scenarios such as digital selves and cloudmind collaborations. Applications could be adopted in tiers of advancing complexity and risk, starting with health tracking, followed by information seeking and entertainment, and finally, self-actualization. By linking brains to the Internet, BCIs could allow individuals to be more highly connectable not just to communications networks but also to other minds, and thus could enable participation in new kinds of collective applications such as a cloudmind. A cloudmind (or crowdmind) is the concept of multiple individual minds (human or machine) joined together to pursue a collaborative goal such as problem solving, idea generation, creative expression, or entertainment. The prospect of cloudminds raises questions about individual versus collective personhood. Some of the necessary conditions for individuals to feel comfortable in joining a cloudmind include privacy, security, reversibility, and retention of personal identity. Blockchain technology might be employed to orchestrate the security, automation, coordination, and credit-assignation requirements of cloudmind collaborations.},

	abstract = {A core element of modern human society is its capacity to rapidly and efficiently communicate through multiple digital formats. Today, we are witnessing exponential progress in our ability to communicate essentially instantaneously on a global scale. When we extrapolate along this trajectory, particularly in view of the equally exponential advances being made in the domains of nanotechnology, nanomedicine, and AI, it appears logical that the communication platforms we use today in the form of smart phones, etc. will continue in their sophistication and miniaturization to the point where they cease to be external devices and become intimately and seamlessly integrated with our biologies. Specifically, the future discipline of neuralnanorobotics (via a set of hypothetical, for now, nanorobotic species designated as endoneurorobots, gliabots, and synapobots) might facilitate a direct and seamless interface between the human neocortex and the cloud/edge, referred to here as a Brain/Cloud Interface (B/CI). This new paradigm may enable us to access the full breadth of human knowledge and engage in fully immersive entertainment and with high-resolution fully sensorial avatars, with the potential capacity to literally experience portions of other individual lives through “transparent shadowing” (TS) applications. Further, at the societal level, B/CIs may assist in ameliorating the loneliness epidemic (as virtual digital presences/experiences will be essentially indistinguishable from reality) and facilitate the propagation of human empathy worldwide. This may result in reduction of potential conflicts and enhanced cooperation. This chapter will explore these paradigm-shifting possibilities for cognitive augmentation toward envisioning what may be possible within the next few decades.},

	abstract = {The Internet comprises a decentralized global system that serves humanity’s collective effort to generate, process, and store data, most of which is handled by the rapidly expanding cloud. A stable, secure, real-time system may allow for interfacing the cloud with the human brain. One promising strategy for enabling such a system, denoted here as a “human brain/cloud interface” (“B/CI”), would be based on technologies referred to here as “neuralnanorobotics.” Future neuralnanorobotics technologies are anticipated to facilitate accurate diagnoses and eventual cures for the ∼400 conditions that affect the human brain. Neuralnanorobotics may also enable a B/CI with controlled connectivity between neural activity and external data storage and processing, via the direct monitoring of the brain’s ∼86 × 109 neurons and ∼2 × 1014 synapses. Subsequent to navigating the human vasculature, three species of neuralnanorobots (endoneurobots, gliabots, and synaptobots) could traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB), enter the brain parenchyma, ingress into individual human brain cells, and autoposition themselves at the axon initial segments of neurons (endoneurobots), within glial cells (gliabots), and in intimate proximity to synapses (synaptobots). They would then wirelessly transmit up to ∼6 × 1016 bits per second of synaptically processed and encoded human–brain electrical information via auxiliary nanorobotic fiber optics (30 cm3) with the capacity to handle up to 1018 bits/sec and provide rapid data transfer to a cloud based supercomputer for real-time brain-state monitoring and data extraction. A neuralnanorobotically enabled human B/CI might serve as a personalized conduit, allowing persons to obtain direct, instantaneous access to virtually any facet of cumulative human knowledge. Other anticipated applications include myriad opportunities to improve education, intelligence, entertainment, traveling, and other interactive experiences. A specialized application might be the capacity to engage in fully immersive experiential/sensory experiences, including what is referred to here as “transparent shadowing” (TS). Through TS, individuals might experience episodic segments of the lives of other willing participants (locally or remote) to, hopefully, encourage and inspire improved understanding and tolerance among all members of the human family.},

Dispossessed of their original wealth, Africans have been forced to live in fabled and fabricated houses, eating fabled and fabricated food-closer to animals. Similarly, dispossessed of their original human identities, Africans have been forced to adopt fabricated identities. With the twenty-first century not promising any return to original African human identities, Africans are set to be further nanotechnologically (using tiny nanoparticles) fabricated into cyborgs that speak to ongoing posthumanist and transhumanist experiments with emergent disruptive technologies. Inhabiting not only fabricated houses but also increasingly inhabiting nanotechnologically fabled and fabricated bodies, Africans should learn to, in terms of the Shona (a people of Zimbabwe) proverb, hakuna mhou inokumira mhuru isiri yayo (no cow lows for a calf that is not its own), repossess original mastery over their own lives.},
