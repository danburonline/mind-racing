These protocols rely on physiological, as opposed to phenomenological, evidence of their reactivation. While dream content can predict post-sleep memory enhancement, dreaming itself remains a black box. Here, we present a novel protocol using a new wearable electronic device, Dormio, to automatically generate serial auditory dream incubations at sleep onset, wherein targeted information is repeatedly presented during the hypnagogic period, enabling direct incorporation of this information into dream content, a process we call targeted dream incubation (TDI). Along with validation data, we discuss how Dormio and TDI protocols can serve as tools for controlled experimentation on dream content, shedding light on the role of dreams in the overnight transformation of experiences into memories.},

BCI control was achieved through dry-electrode electroencephalography (EEG) obtained during imaginary movements. Rather than using low-level direct motor control, we employed a high-level control scheme of the robot, acquired via reinforcement learning, to keep the users cognitive load low while allowing control a reaching-grasping task with multiple degrees of freedom. High-level commands were obtained by classification of EEG responses using an artificial neural network approach utilizing time-frequency features and conveyed through an intuitive user interface. The novel ombination of a rapidly operational dry electrode setup, autonomous control and Internet connectivity made it possible to conveniently interface subjects in an EEG laboratory with remote robotic devices in a closed-loop setup with online visual feedback of the robots actions to the subject. The same approach is also suitable to provide home-bound patients with the possibility to control state-of-the-art robotic devices currently confined to a research environment. Thereby, our BCI approach could help severely paralyzed patients by facilitating patient-centered research of new means of communication, mobility and independence.},

This“Absence of occupation is not rest, A mind quite vacant is a mind distress'd.” Retirement—William Cowper In recent years, there has been increasing interest in functional neuroimaging studies of the brain in a state of ‘rest’. This interest has led to the idea that, at rest, we return to a ‘default mode’, which plays a critical role in the ‘intrinsic ’ functioning of the brain (Shulman et al., 1997; Gusnard and Raichle, 2001). We believe that these three claims, and their synthesis, should be evaluated critically for theoretical and practical reasons. If they are valid, then the resting state is indeed a context in which to study brain processes that are fundamental and important relative to the small flickers of activity produced by task demands. It would follow that cognitively driven fluctuations cannot be interpreted except in the context of the default system.},

	abstract = {Psychology has recently been viewed as facing a replication crisis because efforts to replicate past study findings frequently do not show the same result. Often, the first study showed a statistically significant result but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the first study results were false positives, and whether the replication study correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies, and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and meta-analysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology’s alleged crisis, the large sample sizes typically needed to provide firm evidence will almost always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample sizes and single study replications.

In this review, we contend that the search for neuroimaging biomarkers—neuromarkers—of mental disorders is a highly promising avenue toward improved psychiatric healthcare. However, many of the traditional tools used for psychiatric neuroimaging are inadequate for the identification of neuromarkers. Specifically, we highlight the need for larger samples and for multivariate analysis. Approaches such as machine learning are likely to be beneficial for interrogating high-dimensional neuroimaging data. We suggest that broad, population-based study designs will be important for developing neuromarkers of mental disorders, and will facilitate a move away from a phenomenological definition of mental disorder categories and toward psychiatric nosology based on biological evidence. We provide an outline of how the development of neuromarkers should occur, emphasizing the need for tests of external and construct validity, and for collaborative research efforts. Finally, we highlight some concerns regarding the development, and use of, neuromarkers in psychiatric healthcare.},

We focus primarily on memories for which the hippocampus is thought to be required due to its central importance in the study of memory. The repertoire of methods employed is expanding and includes optogenetics, transcranial stimulation, deep brain stimulation, cued reactivation during sleep and the use of pharmacological agents. In addition, the possible mechanisms underlying these memory changes have been investigated using techniques such as single unit recording and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

	abstract = {A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) acquires brain signals, analyzes and translates them into commands that are relayed to actuation devices for carrying out desired actions. With the widespread connectivity of everyday devices realized by the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), BCI can empower individuals to directly control objects such as smart home appliances or assistive robots, directly via their thoughts. However, realization of this vision is faced with a number of challenges, most importantly being the issue of accurately interpreting the intent of the individual from the raw brain signals that are often of low fidelity and subject to noise. Moreover, pre-processing brain signals and the subsequent feature engineering are both time-consuming and highly reliant on human domain expertise. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a unified deep learning based framework that enables effective human-thing cognitive interactivity in order to bridge individuals and IoT objects. We design a reinforcement learning based Selective Attention Mechanism (SAM) to discover the distinctive features from the input brain signals. In addition, we propose a modified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to distinguish the inter-dimensional information forwarded from the SAM. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed framework, we conduct extensive real-world experiments and demonstrate that our model outperforms a number of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. Two practical real-time human-thing cognitive interaction applications are presented to validate the feasibility of our approach.},

	abstract = {Brain functions are required to be read for curing neurological illness. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) connects the brain to the digital world for brain signals receiving, recording, processing, and comprehending. With a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), the information from the user's brain is fed into actuation devices, which then carry out the actions programmed into them. The Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible to connect a wide range of everyday devices. Asynchronous BCIs can benefit from an improved system architecture proposed in this paper. Individuals with severe motor impairments will particularly get benefit from this feature. Control commands were translated using a rule-based translation algorithm in traditional BCI systems, which relied only on EEG recordings of brain signals. Examining BCI technology's various and cross-disciplinary applications, this argument produces speculative conclusions about how BCI instruments combined with machine learning algorithms could affect the forthcoming procedures and practices. Compressive sensing and neural networks are used to compress and reconstruct ECoG data presented in this article. The neural networks are used to combine the classifier outputs adaptively based on the feedback. A stochastic gradient descent solver is employed to generate a multi-layer perceptron regressor. An example network is shown to take a 50\% compression ratio and 89\% reconstruction accuracy after training with real-world, medium-sized datasets as shown in this paper.},

Performance and security of applications running in these environments are compared in our experimental work with parameters like CPU performance, file I/O, and memory utilization are compared among both the virtualization technologies. Apart from above parameters, we have also used HTTP load from different continents that is used to showcase how the application running on container and virtual machine perform with traffic around the world.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) has recently become a rising paradigm in the information and communications technology industry, drawing a lot of attentions to professionals and researchers. During the last decade, the dominance of smart phones or tablet computers (known as thin clients) over traditional desktop or laptop computers (known as thick clients) has become more and more evident, reflecting a great change in the way people access the Internet. Despite the recent technology advancements that manufacture a new generation of mobile devices with generous resources, the fact that they can offer only limited processing capacity still remains a painful experience. This problem, fortunately, has been made less severe thanks to the recent adoption of CC platform. CC enables offloading heavy processing tasks up to the “cloud”, leaving only simple jobs to the user-end capacity-limited thin clients. So far, a number of research studies have been carried out, trying to eliminate problems arising from shortcomings in the connection between thin clients and cloud networks, yet little have been found efficient. In this paper, we present a novel architecture, taking advantage of collaboration of thin and thick clients, particularly aiming at optimizing data distribution and utilizing CC resources so that expected Quality-of-Service requirements can be met. We also propose an algorithm to select an optimal resource allocation strategy to satisfy various Service Level Agreements. In order to justify our proposal, we have used both numerical analysis and programming approaches. Simulation result shows that our proposed schemes can improve resource allocation efficiency and achieve better performance than the existing ones.},

In this white paper, we describe Neuralink’s first steps toward a scalable high-bandwidth brain-machine interface system. We have built arrays of small and flexible electrode “threads,” with as many as 3072 electrodes per array distributed across 96 threads. We have also built a neurosurgical robot capable of inserting six threads (192 electrodes) per minute. Each thread can be individually inserted into the brain with micron precision for avoidance of surface vasculature and targeting specific brain regions. The electrode array is packaged into a small implantable device that contains custom chips for low-power on-board amplification and digitization: The package for 3072 channels occupies less than 23×18.5×2 mm3. A single USB-C cable provides full-bandwidth data streaming from the device, recording from all channels simultaneously. This system has achieved a spiking yield of up to 70\% in chronically implanted electrodes. Neuralink’s approach to brain-machine interface has unprecedented packaging density and scalability in a clinically relevant package.},

	abstract = {Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity or brain plasticity, is a process that involves adaptive structural and functional changes to the brain. A good definition is “the ability of the nervous system to change its activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or connections.”[1] Clinically, it is the process of brain changes after injury, such as a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). These changes can either be beneficial (restoration of function after injury), neutral (no change), or negative (can have pathological consequences). Neuroplasticity can be broken down into two major mechanisms: Neuronal regeneration/collateral sprouting: This includes concepts such as synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Functional reorganization: This includes concepts such as equipotentiality, vicariation, and diaschisis. The first mention of the term plasticity in regards to the nervous system was by William James in 1890.[2] However, the term neural plasticity is credited to Jerzy Konorski in 1948[1] and was popularized by Donald Hebb in 1949.[3]},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed our understanding of the human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures (for example, lesion studies) and functions1–3 (for example, task functional MRI (fMRI)). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping4 (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain–behavioural phenotype associations5,6. Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available—with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals—to quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.},

	abstract = {Humans rely on at least two modes of thought: verbal (inner speech) and visual (imagery). Are these modes independent, or does engaging in one entail engaging in the other? To address this question, we performed a behavioral and an fMRI study. In the behavioral experiment, participants received a prompt and were asked to either silently generate a sentence or create a visual image in their mind. They were then asked to judge the vividness of the resulting representation, and of the potentially accompanying representation in the other format. In the fMRI experiment, participants had to recall sentences or images (that they were familiarized with prior to the scanning session) given prompts, or read sentences and view images, in the control, perceptual, condition. An asymmetry was observed between inner speech and visual imagery. In particular, inner speech was engaged to a greater extent during verbal than visual thought, but visual imagery was engaged to a similar extent during both modes of thought. Thus, it appears that people generate more robust verbal representations during deliberate inner speech compared to when their intent is to visualize. However, they generate visual images regardless of whether their intent is to visualize or to think verbally. One possible interpretation of these results is that visual thinking is somehow primary, given the relatively late emergence of verbal abilities during human development and in the evolution of our species.},

To do so, however, requited thinking a new not only the data processing but the whole experimental strategy. The classification is done in real-time by treating the experiments as a signal detection problem in which the computer, in the position of impartial observer, assigns classes to incoming epochs accogding to a predetermined decision rule. Since data collection and processing are interleaved, each classification outcome can be a factor in experiment control as well as in subject feedback.

In this paper we present a low-cost mobile BCI application and demonstrate its potential utility in clinical practice. In particular, we conducted a study in which visual evoked potentials (VEP) of two subjects were analyzed using our mBCI application, under different conditions: inside a laboratory, walking and traveling in a car. The results show that the features of our system (level of synchronization, robustness and signal quality) are acceptable for the demanding standard required for the electrophysiological evaluation of vision. In addition, the mobile recording and cloud computing of VEPs offers a number of advantages over traditional in-lab systems. The presented mobile application could be used for visual impairment screening, for ubiquitous, massive and low-cost evaluation of vision, and as ambulatory diagnostic tool in rural or undeveloped areas.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish the feasibility of manipulating a prosthetic knee directly by using a brain-computer interface (BCI) system in a transfemoral amputee. Although the other forms of control could be more reliable and quick (e.g., electromyography control), the electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI may provide amputees an alternative way to control a prosthesis directly from brain.
METHODS: A transfemoral amputee subject was trained to activate a knee-unlocking switch through motor imagery of the movement of his lower extremity. Surface scalp electrodes transmitted brain wave data to a software program that was keyed to activate the switch when the event-related desynchronization in EEG reached a certain threshold. After achieving more than 90\% reliability for switch activation by EEG rhythm-feedback training, the subject then progressed to activating the knee-unlocking switch on a prosthesis that turned on a motor and unlocked a prosthetic knee. The project took place in the prosthetic department of a Veterans Administration medical center. The subject walked back and forth in the parallel bars and unlocked the knee for swing phase and for sitting down. The success of knee unlocking through this system was measured. Additionally, the subject filled out a questionnaire on his experiences.
RESULTS: The success of unlocking the prosthetic knee mechanism ranged from 50 to 100\% in eight test segments.
CONCLUSION: The performance of the subject supports the feasibility for BCI control of a lower extremity prosthesis using surface scalp EEG electrodes. Investigating direct brain control in different types of patients is important to promote real-world BCI applications.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have long been seen as control interfaces that translate changes in brain activity, produced either by means of a volitional modulation or in response to an external stimulation. However, recent trends in the BCI and neurofeedback research highlight passive monitoring of a user's brain activity in order to estimate cognitive load, attention level, perceived errors and emotions. Extraction of such higher order information from brain signals is seen as a gateway for facilitation of interaction between humans and intelligent systems. Particularly in the field of robotics, passive BCIs provide a promising channel for prediction of user's cognitive and affective state for development of a user-adaptive interaction. In this paper, we first illustrate the state of the art in passive BCI technology and then provide examples of BCI employment in human-robot interaction (HRI). We finally discuss the prospects and challenges in integration of passive BCIs in socially demanding HRI settings. This work intends to inform HRI community of the opportunities offered by passive BCI systems for enhancement of human-robot interaction while recognizing potential pitfalls.},

	abstract = {A Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) provides a new communication channel for severely disabled people who have completely or partially lost control over muscular activity. It is questionable whether a BCI is the best choice for controlling a device if partial muscular activity still is available. For example, gaze-based interfaces can be utilized for people who are still able to control their eye movements. Such interfaces suffer from the lack of a natural degree of freedom for the selection command (e.g., a mouse click). One workaround for this problem is based on so-called dwell times, which easily leads to errors if the users do not pay close attention to where they are looking. We developed a multimodal interface combining eye movements and a BCI to a hybrid BCI, resulting in a robust and intuitive device for touchless interaction. This system especially is capable of dealing with different stimulus complexities.},

They offer an extended degree of freedom either by strengthening or by substituting human peripheral working capacity and have potential applications in various fields such as rehabilitation, affective computing, robotics, gaming, and neuroscience. Significant research efforts on a global scale have delivered common platforms for technology standardization and help tackle highly complex and non-linear brain dynamics and related feature extraction and classification challenges. Time-variant psycho-neurophysiological fluctuations and their impact on brain signals impose another challenge for BCI researchers to transform the technology from laboratory experiments to plug-and-play daily life.

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) acquire brain signals, analyze them, and translate them into commands that are relayed to output devices that carry out desired actions. BCIs do not use normal neuromuscular output pathways. The main goal of BCI is to replace or restore useful function to people disabled by neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, or spinal cord injury. From initial demonstrations of electroencephalography-based spelling and single-neuron-based device control, researchers have gone on to use electroencephalographic, intracortical, electrocorticographic, and other brain signals for increasingly complex control of cursors, robotic arms, prostheses, wheelchairs, and other devices. Brain-computer interfaces may also prove useful for rehabilitation after stroke and for other disorders. In the future, they might augment the performance of surgeons or other medical professionals. Brain-computer interface technology is the focus of a rapidly growing research and development enterprise that is greatly exciting scientists, engineers, clinicians, and the public in general. Its future achievements will depend on advances in 3 crucial areas. Brain-computer interfaces need signal-acquisition hardware that is convenient, portable, safe, and able to function in all environments. Brain-computer interface systems need to be validated in long-term studies of real-world use by people with severe disabilities, and effective and viable models for their widespread dissemination must be implemented. Finally, the day-to-day and moment-to-moment reliability of BCI performance must be improved so that it approaches the reliability of natural muscle-based function.},

	abstract = {A core element of modern human society is its capacity to rapidly and efficiently communicate through multiple digital formats. Today, we are witnessing exponential progress in our ability to communicate essentially instantaneously on a global scale. When we extrapolate along this trajectory, particularly in view of the equally exponential advances being made in the domains of nanotechnology, nanomedicine, and AI, it appears logical that the communication platforms we use today in the form of smart phones, etc. will continue in their sophistication and miniaturization to the point where they cease to be external devices and become intimately and seamlessly integrated with our biologies. Specifically, the future discipline of neuralnanorobotics (via a set of hypothetical, for now, nanorobotic species designated as endoneurorobots, gliabots, and synapobots) might facilitate a direct and seamless interface between the human neocortex and the cloud/edge, referred to here as a Brain/Cloud Interface (B/CI). This new paradigm may enable us to access the full breadth of human knowledge and engage in fully immersive entertainment and with high-resolution fully sensorial avatars, with the potential capacity to literally experience portions of other individual lives through “transparent shadowing” (TS) applications. Further, at the societal level, B/CIs may assist in ameliorating the loneliness epidemic (as virtual digital presences/experiences will be essentially indistinguishable from reality) and facilitate the propagation of human empathy worldwide. This may result in reduction of potential conflicts and enhanced cooperation. This chapter will explore these paradigm-shifting possibilities for cognitive augmentation toward envisioning what may be possible within the next few decades.},

	abstract = {The Internet comprises a decentralized global system that serves humanity’s collective effort to generate, process, and store data, most of which is handled by the rapidly expanding cloud. A stable, secure, real-time system may allow for interfacing the cloud with the human brain. One promising strategy for enabling such a system, denoted here as a “human brain/cloud interface” (“B/CI”), would be based on technologies referred to here as “neuralnanorobotics.” Future neuralnanorobotics technologies are anticipated to facilitate accurate diagnoses and eventual cures for the ∼400 conditions that affect the human brain. Neuralnanorobotics may also enable a B/CI with controlled connectivity between neural activity and external data storage and processing, via the direct monitoring of the brain’s ∼86 × 109 neurons and ∼2 × 1014 synapses. Subsequent to navigating the human vasculature, three species of neuralnanorobots (endoneurobots, gliabots, and synaptobots) could traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB), enter the brain parenchyma, ingress into individual human brain cells, and autoposition themselves at the axon initial segments of neurons (endoneurobots), within glial cells (gliabots), and in intimate proximity to synapses (synaptobots). They would then wirelessly transmit up to ∼6 × 1016 bits per second of synaptically processed and encoded human–brain electrical information via auxiliary nanorobotic fiber optics (30 cm3) with the capacity to handle up to 1018 bits/sec and provide rapid data transfer to a cloud based supercomputer for real-time brain-state monitoring and data extraction. A neuralnanorobotically enabled human B/CI might serve as a personalized conduit, allowing persons to obtain direct, instantaneous access to virtually any facet of cumulative human knowledge. Other anticipated applications include myriad opportunities to improve education, intelligence, entertainment, traveling, and other interactive experiences. A specialized application might be the capacity to engage in fully immersive experiential/sensory experiences, including what is referred to here as “transparent shadowing” (TS). Through TS, individuals might experience episodic segments of the lives of other willing participants (locally or remote) to, hopefully, encourage and inspire improved understanding and tolerance among all members of the human family.},
