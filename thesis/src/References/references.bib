	abstract = {It is shown here that, at least in some situations, it is possible to detect and classify individual evoked responses or "single epochs" with surprising reliability. Evoked responses or event related potentials in human EEG have been mostly studied with off-line analog recording and averaging. It is shown here that, at least in some situations, it is possible to detect and classify individual evoked responses or "single epochs" with surprising reliability. To do so, however, requited thinking a new not only the data processing but the whole experimental strategy. The classification is done in real-time by treating the experiments as a signal detection problem in which the computer, in the position of impartial observer, assigns classes to incoming epochs accogding to a predetermined decision rule. Since data collection and processing are interleaved, each classification outcome can be a factor in experiment control as well as in subject feedback. The discrimination performance, expressed in terms of mutual information, is shown to be both a practical index for procedure optimization and a concise and specific descriptor for the experiment results.},

	abstract = {A Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) provides a new communication channel for severely disabled people who have completely or partially lost control over muscular activity. It is questionable whether a BCI is the best choice for controlling a device if partial muscular activity still is available. For example, gaze-based interfaces can be utilized for people who are still able to control their eye movements. Such interfaces suffer from the lack of a natural degree of freedom for the selection command (e.g., a mouse click). One workaround for this problem is based on so-called dwell times, which easily leads to errors if the users do not pay close attention to where they are looking. We developed a multimodal interface combining eye movements and a BCI to a hybrid BCI, resulting in a robust and intuitive device for touchless interaction. This system especially is capable of dealing with different stimulus complexities.},

Significant research efforts on a global scale have delivered common platforms for technology standardization and help tackle highly complex and non-linear brain dynamics and related feature extraction and classification challenges. Time-variant psycho-neurophysiological fluctuations and their impact on brain signals impose another challenge for BCI researchers to transform the technology from laboratory experiments to plug-and-play daily life.

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) acquire brain signals, analyze them, and translate them into commands that are relayed to output devices that carry out desired actions. BCIs do not use normal neuromuscular output pathways. The main goal of BCI is to replace or restore useful function to people disabled by neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, or spinal cord injury. From initial demonstrations of electroencephalography-based spelling and single-neuron-based device control, researchers have gone on to use electroencephalographic, intracortical, electrocorticographic, and other brain signals for increasingly complex control of cursors, robotic arms, prostheses, wheelchairs, and other devices. Brain-computer interfaces may also prove useful for rehabilitation after stroke and for other disorders. In the future, they might augment the performance of surgeons or other medical professionals. Brain-computer interface technology is the focus of a rapidly growing research and development enterprise that is greatly exciting scientists, engineers, clinicians, and the public in general. Its future achievements will depend on advances in 3 crucial areas. Brain-computer interfaces need signal-acquisition hardware that is convenient, portable, safe, and able to function in all environments. Brain-computer interface systems need to be validated in long-term studies of real-world use by people with severe disabilities, and effective and viable models for their widespread dissemination must be implemented. Finally, the day-to-day and moment-to-moment reliability of BCI performance must be improved so that it approaches the reliability of natural muscle-based function.},

	abstract = {A core element of modern human society is its capacity to rapidly and efficiently communicate through multiple digital formats. Today, we are witnessing exponential progress in our ability to communicate essentially instantaneously on a global scale. When we extrapolate along this trajectory, particularly in view of the equally exponential advances being made in the domains of nanotechnology, nanomedicine, and AI, it appears logical that the communication platforms we use today in the form of smart phones, etc. will continue in their sophistication and miniaturization to the point where they cease to be external devices and become intimately and seamlessly integrated with our biologies. Specifically, the future discipline of neuralnanorobotics (via a set of hypothetical, for now, nanorobotic species designated as endoneurorobots, gliabots, and synapobots) might facilitate a direct and seamless interface between the human neocortex and the cloud/edge, referred to here as a Brain/Cloud Interface (B/CI). This new paradigm may enable us to access the full breadth of human knowledge and engage in fully immersive entertainment and with high-resolution fully sensorial avatars, with the potential capacity to literally experience portions of other individual lives through “transparent shadowing” (TS) applications. Further, at the societal level, B/CIs may assist in ameliorating the loneliness epidemic (as virtual digital presences/experiences will be essentially indistinguishable from reality) and facilitate the propagation of human empathy worldwide. This may result in reduction of potential conflicts and enhanced cooperation. This chapter will explore these paradigm-shifting possibilities for cognitive augmentation toward envisioning what may be possible within the next few decades.},

	abstract = {The Internet comprises a decentralized global system that serves humanity’s collective effort to generate, process, and store data, most of which is handled by the rapidly expanding cloud. A stable, secure, real-time system may allow for interfacing the cloud with the human brain. One promising strategy for enabling such a system, denoted here as a “human brain/cloud interface” (“B/CI”), would be based on technologies referred to here as “neuralnanorobotics.” Future neuralnanorobotics technologies are anticipated to facilitate accurate diagnoses and eventual cures for the ∼400 conditions that affect the human brain. Neuralnanorobotics may also enable a B/CI with controlled connectivity between neural activity and external data storage and processing, via the direct monitoring of the brain’s ∼86 × 109 neurons and ∼2 × 1014 synapses. Subsequent to navigating the human vasculature, three species of neuralnanorobots (endoneurobots, gliabots, and synaptobots) could traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB), enter the brain parenchyma, ingress into individual human brain cells, and autoposition themselves at the axon initial segments of neurons (endoneurobots), within glial cells (gliabots), and in intimate proximity to synapses (synaptobots). They would then wirelessly transmit up to ∼6 × 1016 bits per second of synaptically processed and encoded human–brain electrical information via auxiliary nanorobotic fiber optics (30 cm3) with the capacity to handle up to 1018 bits/sec and provide rapid data transfer to a cloud based supercomputer for real-time brain-state monitoring and data extraction. A neuralnanorobotically enabled human B/CI might serve as a personalized conduit, allowing persons to obtain direct, instantaneous access to virtually any facet of cumulative human knowledge. Other anticipated applications include myriad opportunities to improve education, intelligence, entertainment, traveling, and other interactive experiences. A specialized application might be the capacity to engage in fully immersive experiential/sensory experiences, including what is referred to here as “transparent shadowing” (TS). Through TS, individuals might experience episodic segments of the lives of other willing participants (locally or remote) to, hopefully, encourage and inspire improved understanding and tolerance among all members of the human family.},
