\section*{BCI software on the cloud}
\label{chapter2-bci-software-on-the-cloud}

Looking at \autoref{fig:nci-components}, we can see that the three software layers of a BCI-component illustration, as pictured on \autoref{fig:bci-components} are highlighted. This is due to the fact that these components are not bound to a physical interface such as a cable or Bluetooth.

Running software on the cloud means that developers or companies can access provisioned information technology (IT) infrastructure through the internet, usually with a pay-as-you-go pricing model \citep{amazon_web_services_inc_what_nodate}. The development speed of software applications can drastically improve since software developers can only focus on software rather than incorporating the hardware and network aspect of setting up their server farms, therefore abstracting the hardware part away. What started with simple computers that can be rented in a remote server farm such as it was with, e.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) \citep{barr_amazon_2006} ended up being a diverse offering from cloud providers with various abstraction levels as shown in \autoref{tab:cloud-computing-types}.

The majority of businesses are anticipated to embrace a cloud-first strategy by 2025, according to Milind Govekar, vice president of IT research and consultancy company Gartner, and will not be able to fully implement their digital plans without the usage of cloud-native architectures and technologies \citep{gartner_gartner_nodate}. The impact and importance of cloud computing cannot be underestimated, and its success is also reflected in the annual spending on cloud computing resources, estimated at â‚¬474 billion in 2022 \citep{gartner_gartner_nodate}. Cloud computing is such an extensive and complex topic that it could quickly fill entire books. The author categorises three essential points from a bird's eye view that certainly plays a vital role in BCI software: 1. Dedicated and deterministic environments, which explains that an environment of a software programme always stays the same independent of the end-users hardware, 2. elastic and high-performance availability, which explains cloud computers that have an on-demand and adjustable high-performance and 3. provided services for speed, which explains the concept of pre-made and dedicated software written primarily for the cloud and specific use cases. The following list goes more into detail about the mentioned topics in the context of BCI software:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Dedicated and deterministic environments:} Running code for BCIs on different end-user platforms, such as Windows or Android, can have drawbacks because each device has its processor, graphics card, operating system version and drivers, which can make developing software that requires stable and good performance, such as a neural data processing pipelines, time-consuming and difficult to maintain, as developers must keep track of every factor of the end-user devices. This is fine for BCIs that are not intended for the general public, such as specially designed BCIs for people with, say, locked-in syndrome, but for the general public, a vast amount of different end-user devices could come into play. When code is run on a dedicated machine, such as a cloud computer with clearly defined hardware and operating system specifications, it becomes less error-prone and more deterministic.
  \item \textbf{Elastic and high-performance availability:} Because the cloud usually runs as an as-needed model, the initial purchase cost of computer hardware is split and shared across usage. Developers have access to tremendous computing power that would not be easily afforded if purchased independently. As a result, when developing a computationally intensive algorithm, developers can use high-performance central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) to complete tasks much faster than consumer hardware on end-user devices. Performance can also be increased as needed, e.g. to handle computationally heavier tasks that are not used as frequently or to handle more requests when, e.g. the demand for the software increases due to an increase in the number of users, which is a process known as elasticity \citep{gartner_definition_nodate}. Furthermore, the cloud provides far more storage capacity than end-user devices.

  \item \textbf{Provided services for speed:} The vast majority of cloud providers are providing more specialised services as we move closer to PaaS. Provisioned database servers, for example, exist solely to serve as a database, so the underlying hardware is optimised for the database software running on it. Hundreds of cloud computing services are available, including 200 from AWS alone \citep{amazon_web_services_inc_what_nodate}, all of which address specific use cases. This is extremely useful when it comes to cloud-based BCI software. One example is the aspect of live streaming of brain data, which we will go over in greater detail in the implementation chapter of this thesis. The services accelerate development speed by eliminating the need for teams to reinvent the wheel repeatedly, next to also providing out-of-the-box scalability due to built-in elasticity and the concept of fully abstracted hardware via the serverless model  \citep{redhat_what_2022}.
\end{enumerate}

A N/CI utilises cloud computing by running certain software components of a BCI system in the cloud with the benefits as mentioned before. Multiple BCIs can communicate with each other or with other software or hardware over the internet, enabling remote human-computer interaction. \autoref{fig:nci-overview} depicts how two or more BCIs can interface with one another using cloud software. The red arrows represent the typical local BCI. The blue arrow depicts how BCI B  can execute business logic via the cloud over the internet, enabling digital and physical interactions with, e.g. high performance. The green arrow depicts how BCI A can communicate via a N/CI with BCI B even if they are not in the same geographical location.

\section*{Distinction between existing research}
\label{chapter2-distinction-between-existing-research}

The concept of running BCI software components remotely and on the cloud is not novel, as research into the concept known as asynchronous BCI \citep{an_design_2016} or internet-based BCI \citep{lampe_brain-computer_2014} has been ongoing for some time. However, when we look at the more recent research from, e.g. \citeauthor{zhang_internet_2018} on their cloud-based deep learning framework to enable, as they describe Human-Thing Cognitive Interactivity, we see a strong emphasis on algorithms and machine learning but less on aspects such as the cloud architecture and mass-market-readiness \citep{zhang_internet_2018}. They address the latency and the size of EEG samples sent in near-real-time to a server, as well as the corresponding calculation, but there are no more details in regards to the proposed and very simplified architecture chart's components or effective cloud architecture, all of which factor into the author's aim to develop a N/CI. Another related and even more recent paper by \citeauthor{ahamad_system_2022} looks at the system architecture of a BCI for the Internet of Things (IoT), but this time from the perspective of algorithms optimised for time series data such as EEG, but still with no mention of the effective cloud architecture of such a system \citep{ahamad_system_2022}.

The author of this thesis introduces the concept of three-dimensionality for the definition of a N/CI based on the previously mentioned topics and research that touch on the issues of this thesis, which are essential to achieve general applicability for BCIs from the perspective of the software system for the actual implementation of such a system.

\section*{Requirements of a N/CI}
\label{chapter2-requirements-of-a-nci}

The term N/CI positions itself as a software system in the intersection that can undoubtedly be defined as production-grade rather than being in the PoC stage, unobtrusive implementation rather than obtrusive software and general-purpose applicability rather than being made just for a specific use case. \autoref{fig:nci-definition} illustrates the position of a N/CI within the mentioned properties. Subsequently, \autoref{tab:nci-axis} summarises the definitions as described in this thesis.

\newpage

With an unobtrusive form factor like e.g. the one developed by IDUN Technologies, a significant hardware barrier to becoming a mass-market BCI has already been tackled. Next to the hardware, IDUN intends to provide a business-to-business (B2B) software platform, allowing 3rd-party developers to create software on top of IDUN's offerings through a universal brain application programming interface (API). Because they allow others to consume this API in end-user-facing apps, it must be production-ready and unobtrusively able to be integrated. IDUN's hardware and software aim to be general-purpose rather than specific, allowing others to build any BCI-enhanced app \citep{idun_guardian_nodate}.

All of IDUN's requirements systematise one of the first BCI aimed at the general public, which satisfies the broad definition of a N/CI. The fundamental motivation of the author is to standardise collaboration and research on this novel and interdisciplinary field of BCI software and cloud computing.
