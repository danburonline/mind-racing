\section{Background}
\label{chapter1-background}

There has been a long-standing interest in developing neural interfaces, systems that sense electrical impulses from the nervous system and use them to intercommunicate with the human brain. Successful research into the development of technologies that enable neural interfaces has been going on for decades. Progress has accelerated significantly in the past few years, especially since the advent of modern processing capabilities such as deep learning and innovation in material science. In particular, a subdiscipline called brain-computer interfacing (BCI), a field focused on the direct interaction between brains and computers, has accumulated much momentum since the popularity of companies like Neuralink and Kernel.

One aspect of neural interfaces is hardware tailored to the human body. Whether it is an invasive sensor, such as in electrocorticography (ECoG), a method which measures electrical activities produced by neurons firing inside the skull, or a non-invasively placed sensor on the body, such as in electroencephalography (EEG), another method which also reads neuronal activity but outside the skull and thus with much lower precision. The other aspect is software that reads and interprets data of these hardware sensors. Both aspects present their own set of challenges and complexities. Nonetheless, complete and applicable neural interfaces work in practice and have been used for many years in patients with neurological disorders. There are also consumer and non-clinical neural interfaces available, such as the Neurosity and OpenBCI products, which aim to democratise the use of EEG sensors by offering low-cost hardware and simple-to-use software.
