\section{Summary}
\label{summary}

% - Research question: Does the REFOCUS treatment work?
% - Study: treatment group and placebo group with self-reported depression measured afterwards
% - Findings: Depression was lower after the REFOCUS treatment compared to placebo

\section{Interpretation}
\label{interpretation}

% - Explanation 1: REFOCUS treatment reduced depression
% - Explanation 2: placebo treatment increased depression
% - However, explanation 2 is unlikely because the same placebo was used in studies
% A, B, C and there it didn't increase depression

\section{Integration}
\label{integration}

% - Previous research focused on the question of how unprocessed traumas could cause
% depression
% - We are the first who tested the “focus” explanation of depression

\section{Implications}
\label{implications}

% - It is widely believed that depression is caused by unprocessed traumas
% - Our findings offer a novel perspective: depression is caused by information
% processing style
% - Hence, new approach, new line of research to understand depression, new types of
% treatment

\section{Limitations}
\label{limitations}

% - We had no measure of depression prior to the treatment
% - Reason: asking people to score their depression twice can lead to problems
% (references)
% - Consequence: we don’t know whether depression decreased in treatment
% group (explanation 1) or increased in placebo group (explanation 2)
% - However, as mentioned before, it is unlikely that depression increased
% - Sample size was relatively low
% - Reason: it’s hard to find enough people with a major depression
% - However, our results were significant despite the low sample size. This speaks
% to the effectiveness of the treatment
