\chapter{Attached repositories}
\label{appendix6-attached-repositories}

This appendix lists and describes the attached repositories, that is, the code produced during the 10 sprints to create the new version of IDUN’s NIP and the source code of the written part of this project.

\section*{idn-guardian-cloud}

This repository is a monorepo that contains the infrastructure for the cloud for IDUNs N/CI at the time of writing.

\section*{idn-guardian-console}

This repository contains the source code for the Console web app for IDUNs N/CI at the time of creation. It also contains an example of exporting an iOS and Android app.

\section*{idn-guardian-sdk}

This repository is a monorepo containing the source code of the Guardian SDK, IDUN’s public SDK. It contains all files at the time of writing and is not complete as most of the business logic, for example, to connect to the BLE device, is handled in the Console web app repository.

\section*{idn-internal-sdk}

This is a shallow Python repository that will host the internal SDK for IDUN’s backend microservices.

\section*{spatial-place}

This is the actual repository where the work was written in LaTeX. It contains all source files, READMEs and other information.
