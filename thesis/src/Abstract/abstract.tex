    This is a rough draft of the abstract: There are various types of neural interfaces. There are various types of software for neural interfaces. There are various types of users for neural interfaces. The advantages and disadvantages of using local software versus software running in the cloud. A neural/cloud-based interface is defined as a production-ready and mainstream-ready BCI application in this thesis. Connecting web-based BCIs to the future of software, moving towards 3D and spatial computing, and how the web can play an essential role alongside BCI unobtrusive BCI technologies. Paradigm-shift for BCI software and 3D software running in browsers.

    The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of a neural/cloud interface and the components that comprise it. To lay the groundwork for future developers based on empirical technical experience in developing a real-world neural/cloud interface for IDUN Technologies' in-ear EEG sensor product. As part of this project, an open-source sample code is provided.

    We also discuss 3D on the web and the implications for human-computer interaction with a BCI based on a neural/cloud interface. Demonstrating the potential for additional use cases and the future of BCI software, web applications, and 3D software.
