    Internet of Humans means the connection between humans through the internet, as we understand the internet of things by today's standards. Includes for example heart rate data, emotional states and especially interesting in regard to interfacing with other beings and things: neural activity. Current state of brain-computer interfaces in-lab full-cap EEG or invasive deep brain stimulation. Plenty of startups to create unobtrusive brain-computer interfaces, mainly using EEG technology.
    
    For this paper I'm utilizing a fairly new unobtrusive two-channel in-ear EEG-sensor to deliver brain signals to the cloud in order to interact with another human brain through the internet to play a simple web-based 3D multiplayer game. The architecture is end-to-end and to make it work I utilized a client-side spatial auditory steady-state evoked potential-evoked in order to evoke neuromarkers that the in-ear BCI can detect which will be needed to create actions in real-time that the software on the cloud can detect. There are several more things in order to create a brain/cloud interface architecture to be able to interface with things/other humans as well as it being secure, privacy-focused etc. In my paper, I concentrate on the bird view of the end-to-end architecture which allows a multiplayer game in a browser-based game. A focus of this paper includes the implementation of validated spatial audio evoked neuromarkers in order to fulfil simple two-action multiplayer game mechanics and the validation of a secure and scalable neural data ingestion cloud architecture.
    
    What it is: Two-channel in-ear electroencephalography spatial auditory steady state evoked potentials based brain-computer interface to enable the internet of humans through interacting with another human brain via a brain/cloud interface.
