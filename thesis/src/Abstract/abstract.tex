  This is a rough draft of the abstract (not intended for reader as of now): There is BCI software, potential for BCI software on the cloud, benefits of cloud computing, quest to put BCI software on the cloud. There needs to be a definition, three-dimensionality for a N/CI. What is a N/CI? How can we achieve something like this with contemporary technologies? What for components make up a N/CI? IDUN Technologies, case study, results from case study etc.
