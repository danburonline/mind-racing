\chapter{Implementation}
\graphicspath{{Chapter4/Figs/}{Chapter4/Figs/}}

% empirical software engineering done in the case study based on user-centred design process via user interviews or expert interviews and internal group discussions and ongoing literature research.

% make the connection back from NIP to N/CI and how this happened and why i mentioned it earlier already

\section{Web-first approach to software}
\label{chapter4-web-first-approach-to-software}

% non-trivial, n-body system, Services, batch processing and near real time streaming, shared nothing, encrypted, total order broadcast etc. => all insights that were gained for the N/CI and the task to define a N/CI on its own as well + Systems of record and derived data system (p 602 to cite) ==> add some parts to the implementation chapter

% However, in practice, it appears that simply making data available quickly—even if it is in a quirky, difficult-to-use, raw format—is often more valuable than trying to decide on the ideal data model up front [54].

% - Distributed system, data warehouse and other constraints that came up during the research etc. + non-critical, no-real-time needed, system on a chip is coming and what will it bring for things, or going directly via the internet and not the device itself, why not making that decision
% - Data warehouse difference between data lake
% - feature store

% What production-grade software separates from others
% Use The Twelve Factors as a reference

% \subsection{Modern web APIs for BCI}
% \label{chapter2-modern-web-apis-for-bcis}

% Examples of BCI data going through web stacks, how to make it work (paper from Stegman)
% Use this as well https://urish.medium.com/reactive-brain-waves-af07864bb7d4

% \subsection{3D applications in the browser}
% \label{chapter2-3d-applications-in-the-browser}

% Current state of 3D on the web (WebGPU, pixel streaming, declarative graphics components, WebAssembly (and Rust), etc.)

\section{Web-based AR and VR}
\label{chapter2-web-based-ar-and-vr}

% Current state of VR and AR applications (Meta Quest, Snapchat, ARKit, etc.)

% Umfassende und anschauliche (idealerweise Bildmaterial, Screenshots, Zwischenstände. Auch Fehlschläge dokumentieren) Dokumentation, was genau getan / erstellt / programmiert / produziert / etc. wurde. Welche Auffälligkeiten gab es? Welche Entscheidungen wurden getroffen? Welche Änderungen / Einschränkungen / Erweiterungen wurden vorgenommen?
