\chapter{Implementation}
\graphicspath{{Chapter4/Figs/}{Chapter4/Figs/}}

This chapter goes into the implementation details of building the software-parts for the NIP of IDUN Technologies and the key events that occurred during the research and development such as the realisation of the novelty and need of a definition for a N/CI. Next to that the author also discusses other key aspects from building the system.

\section{Timeline}
\label{chapter4-timeline}

This is the implementation timeline as it was at the time of writing the thesis.

  \label{fig:implementation-timeline}
\end{figure}

Based on this we will go through each key event in a chronological manner, still starting with the most fundamental key events.

% empirical software engineering done in the case study based on user-centred design process via user interviews or expert interviews and internal group discussions and ongoing literature research.
% MENTION analysis paralysis

\subsection{Feature store and MLOps}
\label{chapter4-feature-store-and-mlops}
% explain MLOps and outlook with Kubeflow
% mention data lakes and data warehouse
% mention internal SDK for feature extraction and experiments
% what is feature extraction and the process
% show image from Wadda

    % However, in practice, it appears that simply making data available quickly—even if it is in a quirky, difficult-to-use, raw format—is often more valuable than trying to decide on the ideal data model up front [54].
