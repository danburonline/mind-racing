\label{chapter4-demos}
% show image of the investor demo room
% just say that we had some moments inbetween with demos

\section{Key aspects}
\label{chapter4-key-aspects}

\subsection{Stream-based events}
\label{chapter4-stream-based-events}
% explain event based architecture and the paradigm-shift in building stream based architectures

\subsection{Hardware encryption}
\label{chapter4-hardware-encryption}
% discussion with andy

\subsection{Device-based authentication}
\label{chapter4-device-based-authentication}

\label{chapter4-graph-database}

\subsection{Feature stores and MLOps}
\label{chapter4-feature-stores-and-mlops}
% explain mlops and outlook with kubeflow
% mention data lakes and data warehouse

    % However, in practice, it appears that simply making data available quickly—even if it is in a quirky, difficult-to-use, raw format—is often more valuable than trying to decide on the ideal data model up front [54].

\subsection{Internal SDK}
\label{chapter4-internal-sdk}
% what is feature extraction and the process
% show image from Wadda
