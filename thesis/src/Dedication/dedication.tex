	I want to dedicate this work to the IDUN Technologies team, who have been so helpful to me on my journey into the neurotechnology industry. They taught me a lot about working in a scientific setting and gave me the opportunity to investigate various aspects of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces. I'd also like to thank the open-source collective Poimandres for their support of their WebGL libraries, which has greatly aided me in comprehending some of the most complex challenges in WebXR development.
