  This work is dedicated to the team at IDUN Technologies, who have been so helpful on my journey entering the neurotechnology industry. They taught me a lot about working in a scientific setting and gave me the opportunity to investigate various aspects of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces in combination with cloud computing and virtual reality. I'd also like to thank the open-source collective Poimandres for the support of their WebGL libraries, which has greatly aided me in comprehending some of the most complex challenges in WebXR/3D development.
