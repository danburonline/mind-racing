  This work is dedicated to the IDUN Technologies\footnote{Neurotechnology startup in ZÃ¼rich: https://iduntechnologies.com} team, who have been extremely helpful in my journey into the neurotechnology industry. They taught me a lot about working in a scientific setting and allowed me to investigate various aspects of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces in conjunction with cloud computing and virtual reality.

  I'd also like to thank the open-source collective Poimandres\footnote{Developers behind various Three.js libraries: https://docs.pmnd.rs}  for their WebGL libraries, which have helped me understand some of the most difficult challenges in 3D graphics programming.
